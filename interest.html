            <p>
                I discovered data science in high school after taking AP Statistics, which introduced me to the practice side of analytical skills. In a programming course, I worked on a fantasy football trade analyzer project. This project demonstrated the real-world potential of data science and confirmed my interest in the field. My academic experiences and projects have shown me that data science can be applied in various areas, from data manipulation and visualization to full-stack development

                Outside of academics, I maintain a balance by engaging in personal interests. I lift weights regularly to improve myself and enjoy playing sports with friends. Music also plays a significant role in my life. I both listen to and play music, enjoying genres such as rap, pop, country, and R&B.

                These interests help keep me balanced and motivated. Some key aspects of my life include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fitness:</strong> Regular weight lifting and playing sports help me stay physically active.</li>
                <li><strong>Sports:</strong> Following the Knicks and Jets is a long-standing interest rooted in my childhood.</li>
                <li><strong>Music:</strong> I enjoy both listening to and playing music, covering genres like rap, pop, country, and R&B.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This combination of academic focus and personal interests defines my approach to work and life.
