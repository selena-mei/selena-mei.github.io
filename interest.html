                Outside of academics, I maintain a balance by engaging in personal interests. 
        I lift weights regularly to improve myself and enjoy playing sports with friends. 
        Music also plays a significant role in my life. I both listen to and play music, 
        enjoying genres such as rap, pop, country, and R&B.
            </p>
            <p>
                These interests help keep me balanced and motivated. Some key aspects of my life include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fitness:</strong> Regular weight lifting and playing sports help me stay physically active.</li>
                <li><strong>Sports:</strong> Following the Knicks and Jets is a long-standing interest rooted in my childhood.</li>
                <li><strong>Music:</strong> I enjoy both listening to and playing music, covering genres like rap, pop, country, and R&B.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This combination of academic focus and personal interests defines my approach to work and life.
