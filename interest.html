                Prior College, I wanted to explore my interests as much as I can, 
                so I took the initiative to intern at the American repertory theater for a summer, 
                where I facilitated and promoted pre-show events along with four other youth action team members. 
                However, my passion for my major really grew due to the opportunity I had to participate at a Data Analytics Summer Camp, at Suffolk University.
                I was given the opportunity to learn Complex Excel, as well as exercising my analytics skills. Wanting to dive deeper into my passion,
                I started my college journey majoring in both Business Administration and Data Science. Additionally, I am involved in the Skills Development cohort of Women in Finance at Northeastern University,
                a student-lead cohort where upperclassmen come in and teach their technicals and soft skills to the members (e.g., how to read balance sheets). I am also involved in the Webuild cohort of WISE, 
                Women's Interdisciplinary Society of Entrepreneurship at Northeastern University.

              With the focus on personal growth early on, I picked up boxing. Taking regular visits to the gym, 
        I invested the second half of my high school years into the sport. At the same time, I grew an interest for true crime documentaries.
        Some of my favorite true crime podcasts include: Stephanie Soo. While I stopped membership for boxing since college started, 
        I continue to practice occasionally on my own. Additionally, I kept myself busy playing seasonal sports with friends; winter is my favorite season for this reason.
        Finally, for the longest time, I've always love music. Have you heard of Jennie from Blackpink? She just dropped a new album!
