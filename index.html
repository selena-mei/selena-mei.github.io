                Hello! My name is Selena Mei. I am a sophomore, currently pursuing Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and 
              Data Science at Northeastern University. During my free my freeome background about me is that I am originally from China. I moved to the United States, Boston, when I was 6 with my parents. Since then, I've grew up in Boston.

              My name is Jonathan Wong, and I am an aspiring data analyst currently
                pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Science at Northeastern University.
                I have a strong passion for transforming raw data into meaningful insights through the
                power of machine learning and data visualization. My technical skills include Python programming,
                data analysis with Pandas and Numpy, and building dynamic dashboards. In addition to my academic efforts,
                I have project experience, such as developing a Calorie Predictor Dashboard using machine learning techniques
                and contributing to a full-stack web application project called SkillSeeker.
            </p>

                Originally from New Jersey, I am not only passionate about data science but also deeply interested in fitness,
                sports, and music. I support the New York Knicks and the New York Jets, and I enjoy staying active and engaged
                in my community. My professional journey includes value work experience that has enhanced my teamwork and communication
                skills, and I am actively seeking internships and co-op opportunities where I can contribute to real-world projects.
