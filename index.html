                Hello! My name is Selena Mei. I am a second-year student, 
                currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and Data Science at Northeastern University. 
                Additionally, I am an aspiring data analyst, 
                hoping to apply my skills to real-world challenges and make a meaningful impact 
                in the ever-evolving landscape of business and data analytics.
                With a strong analytical mindset and a keen interest in problem-solving, 
                I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and business to create innovative solutions.
                With my previous work experiences and coursework that had both enhance my technical and soft skills,
                I am actively seeking internships and co-op opportunities where I hope to gain hands-on experience and build on to my
                personal and career growth. 
              
            </p>
        <h2> Fun Facts About Me:</h2>
            <p>
                While I am known to most as Selena Mei, my legal name is Xing Yi Mei. Originally from China, 
                I moved with my family to the United States when I was 6 years old and lived in Boston, Massachusetts ever since.
                During interviews, I would be often asked "what do you look forward to the most out of this co-op?". 
                I would answer: "Personal Growth". That said, I dedicate most of my free time to exploring my interests. 
                I am not only passionate about data science but also deeply interested in boxing, fitness, music, and true crime.
